In this mini project, I explored how to implement drill-down functionality in Power BI visualizations to create interactive, layered insights.

Steps I Followed:
1.Explored the Data Structure
Worked with two tables: Apocalypse Sales and Purchase Tracker.
Identified key hierarchies within the data (Store → Product, Customer → Order ID).

2.Created a Basic Visualization
Built a stacked column chart displaying total purchase amounts by store.
Added store names as the legend for a clear breakdown of spending.

3.Implemented Drill-Down Functionality
Added Product under Store to create a hierarchy in the visualization.
Enabled drill-down mode, allowing users to click on a store and see product-level details.

4.Explored Different Drill-Down Options
Used "Go to Next Level" to navigate deeper into the hierarchy.
Used "Expand All Down One Level" to break down data across all stores.

5.Applied Drill-Down to a Real-World Use Case
Created a customer-level visualization and added Order ID as a drill-down layer.
Tested clicking on a customer to view individual order IDs, a functionality often needed in business analysis.

6.Final Adjustments and Insights
Refined chart layouts for better readability.
Tested drill-up and drill-down interactions to ensure smooth transitions.
