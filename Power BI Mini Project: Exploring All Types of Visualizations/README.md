In this mini project, I explored various Power BI visualizations, identifying the most commonly used ones and their best applications.

Steps I Followed:
1.Loaded and Prepared Data
Combined Product ID and Product ID Purchased to establish relationships.
Ensured data was correctly structured for visualization.

2.Explored Commonly Used Visualizations
Created a Stacked Bar Chart to visualize unit sales by product with color-coded categories.
Used a 100% Stacked Column Chart to analyze customer purchase breakdowns.
Built a Line Chart to track product sales trends over time, grouped by month.
Implemented a Line & Clustered Column Chart to compare price vs. production cost.

3.Examined Alternative Visualizations
Scatter Chart: Plotted price vs. production cost with product categories as legends.
Donut Chart: Analyzed state-wise total purchases, though less preferred for accuracy.
Card Visualizations: Displayed total sales, order count, and other key metrics for quick insights.
Table View: Listed customers and units sold for a structured tabular reference.

4.Optimized and Formatted Visuals
Added data labels for clarity.
Customized titles and legends to improve readability.
Filtered top products in charts to highlight key trends.

5.Key Takeaways from the Mini Project
Bar and line charts remain the most useful and widely applicable for trend analysis.
Pie and donut charts can be misleading due to difficulty in estimating proportions.
Cards and tables provide quick and structured insights into summary data.
Scatter plots help in identifying outliers and trends in numerical relationships.

Combining multiple visualization types on a dashboard improves data storytelling.
