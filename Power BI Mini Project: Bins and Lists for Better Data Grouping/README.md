In this mini project, I explored how to create and use bins and lists in Power BI to group and analyze data more effectively.
Steps I Followed:
1.Explored Data for Binning and Grouping
Used Apocalypse Sales and Customer Information tables.
Identified categorical (Customer Name) and numeric (Order ID, Age, Date Purchased) fields for grouping.

2.Created Lists for Grouping Customers
Manually grouped customers into “Best Prepping Stores” and “Worst Prepping Stores.”
Used new groups to classify data into predefined segments without writing conditional logic.

3.Used Lists for Numeric Data
Grouped Order IDs into "First Orders" and "Latest Orders."
Made it easier to analyze order trends over time.

4.Created Bins for Numeric Data Segmentation
Age Binning: Created age brackets (10s, 20s, 30s, etc.) to analyze customer demographics.
Date Binning: Segmented purchase dates into monthly bins for better trend analysis.

5.Visualized the Grouped and Binned Data
Plotted age bins vs. buyer count to observe customer demographics.
Analyzed customer lists vs. total sales to compare store performance.
Examined purchase trends across monthly bins.

6.Key Takeaways from the Mini Project
Lists provided an efficient way to categorize data without complex formulas.
Bins helped simplify continuous data (age, date) into manageable categories.
Visualization of bins and lists revealed meaningful patterns in customer behavior and sales trends.
