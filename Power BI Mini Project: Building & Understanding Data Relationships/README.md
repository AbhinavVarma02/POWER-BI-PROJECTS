In this mini project, I explored how to establish and manage relationships between multiple tables in Power BI to create a well-structured data model.

Steps I Followed:
1.Loaded Data into Power BI
Imported Excel data containing Apocalypse Store, Sales, and Customer Information tables.
Skipped transformation as the focus was on modeling relationships.

2.Explored Auto-Generated Relationships
Checked how Power BI automatically detected relationships between tables.
Reviewed the one-to-many relationships and the default single-direction filtering applied.

3.Modified and Recreated Relationships
Manually redefined relationships using Customer ID and Product ID instead of relying on automatically chosen columns.
Changed cross-filter direction to both for more flexible interactions.
Ensured the correct cardinality settings for relationships.

4.Tested Relationship Impact on Data
Created a table visualization to analyze how product sales varied by customer state.
Switched between single and both-direction filtering to observe changes in results.

5.Built Relationships from Scratch
Deleted auto-generated relationships and manually connected tables using drag-and-drop.
Verified settings to confirm relationships were properly structured.

6.Finalized the Data Model
Ensured relationships were active and correctly influencing the report.
Saved changes and prepared for dashboard creation in future projects.
