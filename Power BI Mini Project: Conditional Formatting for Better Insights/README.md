In this mini project, I applied conditional formatting in Power BI to enhance data visualization using color scales, data bars, and icon sets.

Steps I Followed:
1.Set Up the Data for Conditional Formatting
Used the Apocalypse Store table to display Product Name and Price.
Ensured the numeric fields were correctly formatted for visualization.

2.Applied Background Color Formatting
Used gradient color scales to highlight price variations, where cheaper products were green and expensive ones red.
Experimented with rule-based formatting, categorizing prices into different color-coded price tiers.

3.Worked with Data Bars for Visual Comparison
Added Units Sold from the Apocalypse Sales table.
Enabled data bars to visually compare product sales directly within the table.

4.Implemented Icon-Based Formatting
Used conditional icons to indicate high, medium, and low-selling products.
Red icons for low-selling products, yellow for medium sales, and green for top sellers.

5.Refined the Revenue Visualization
Summarized Revenue as a total per product and enabled data bars for a clear comparison.
Identified top-performing products like Weatherproof Jackets and Survival Knives while noticing poor performers like Waterproof Matches and Duct Tape.

6.Final Adjustments and Insights
Verified formatting settings for clarity and readability.
Ensured that visual enhancements provided better insights without overwhelming the report.
